## Executive Summary

This white paper introduces a novel layered model that delineates the relationships among the brain’s physiology, the mind’s cognitive processes, and the emergence of consciousness. To demonstrate the model's real-world utility, three applied scenarios are explored: a virtual assistant interacting with a driver, a clinician coordinating with an AI in a hospital, and an asymmetric awareness situation on an airplane between an awake and a sleeping passenger.

This white paper introduces a novel layered model that delineates the relationships among the brain’s physiology, the mind’s cognitive processes, and the emergence of consciousness. By organizing these elements into hierarchical levels, the framework clarifies how different states of awareness arise and interact in both biological and artificial systems.

The model distinguishes between unconscious (U₀–U₂), preconscious (C₁–C₃), and conscious (C₄–C₇) layers, each associated with specific neural substrates and functional roles. This stratification enables precise mapping of cognitive activities, from basic sensory processing to self-reflective thought.

A core proposition is the model’s applicability to artificial intelligence development. By mirroring human cognitive layering, AI architectures can support graded awareness and feedback loops, fostering more realistic, adaptive, and human-like behavior in autonomous agents.

The framework also addresses state-dependent interactions—such as awake, asleep, or impaired conditions—demonstrating how communication channels between agents open or close based on each entity’s level activation. These insights inform therapeutic approaches, human–machine interfaces, and multi-agent coordination.

Comparative analysis with established theories (Global Workspace, Integrated Information, Predictive Coding \[4] \[4]) reveals that this model’s explicit hierarchical structuring and state‐conditional channels offer a unique perspective, complementing existing neurocognitive paradigms.

Finally, the white paper outlines architectural guidelines and use cases, spanning neuroscience research, AI implementation, robotics, and speculative applications like artificial consciousness and brain–computer integration, underscoring the model’s versatility and innovative potential.
